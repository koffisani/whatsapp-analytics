**UPDATE** May 14 2020. 10:25 AM USA CST. This update is added as response to multiple questions about the chat history file. One file as described in step 1 is enough. But adding multiple conversation files should not dramatically change your logic.

Below is sample conversation exported from WhatsApp
```
[4/25/20, 3:49:49 PM] Cleef Messan: Messages to this chat and calls are now secured with end-to-end encryption.
[4/25/20, 4:37:00 PM] Cleef Messan: Hey Bennu, I am Cleef.
[4/25/20, 4:37:18 PM] Bennu-AI: Hey Cleef, Nice to meet you. how are you doing? 
[4/25/20, 4:38:13 PM] Cleef Messan: I'm well. How are you?
[4/25/20, 4:38:16 PM] Bennu-AI:I am computer bot. I am always well.
[4/25/20, 6:36:23 PM] Cleef Messan: Good for you! You don't have to wear a mask.
[4/25/20, 6:51:09 PM] Cleef Messan: Bennu?
[4/25/20, 6:51:29 PM] Bennu-AI: Yes, Cleef. How can I help you?
[4/25/20, 6:52:02 PM] Cleef Messan: What do you know about the COVID-19?
[4/25/20, 6:52:26 PM] Bennu-AI: I personnaly do not know. I have not had the chance to learn about it. But I can look on the internet. Would you like me to do that?
[4/25/20, 7:15:20 PM] Cleef Messan: No, thanks. We are gathering data for you to learn on it.
[4/25/20, 7:15:22 PM] Bennu-AI: Exciting ü§©üôè. I love learning. I can be a better assistant.
```
There are two users in the chat history, in the name of **Bennu-AI** and **Cleef Messan**.  When the application prompts for a user's name, the input would have to be either **Bennu-AI** or **Cleef Messan**.
